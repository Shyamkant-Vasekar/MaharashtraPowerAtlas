# MaharashtraPowerAtlas
Repository for generating different type of electrical power system maps using GIS techniques

As of now only Marathwada Power Map done. This is a QGIS project. 

Hence you have to use QGIS software for viewing the map.

In this map EHV S/S are shown along with their servable area. Thus using this map we can identify unservable area and there by locations for proposed ehv s/s. On same line work can be done for 33/11kV S/S or 11/.44 DP.

However for this proper identification of load along with their geo-cordinate is very essential.
